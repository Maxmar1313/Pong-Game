This is my first game ever, done in SFML and C++.
It is not best project, it is not pretty, but main purpose of it is to learn new things.
Things I have lernt from this project:
+ GameLoop
+ Handling user input
+ Vector operations
+ Most important: I am able to create computer games(even if it's just simple game).
